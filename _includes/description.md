Chaos Theory amongst the stars! Play with the chaotic behavior
of planets under the influence of newtonian gravity and share your creations.

We've noticed that (yet again), firefox is buggy, and there's no
work around. So... best viewed in chrome, or safari.

Watch the [teaser video](http://youtu.be/Jc0ZW0ke_jc).

Special thanks to [Nick Bartzokas](https://twitter.com/NickBartzokas)
