It's been a bit chaotic at MinuteLabs recently... we've converted our
pendulum lab into a planetary system simulation! Two planets orbiting one
another creates a very predictable pattern, just like a simple pendulum does.
But once you add a third planet, things get chaotic, and it's not possible
to accurately predict where the planets will move unless you had full and
exact knowledge about the initial conditions.

You might notice when you're editing that the screen pans when moving planets around.
This is because the interface will automatically track the center
of mass. It's also the reason why editing the velocity of one planet
changes the others. Tracking the center of mass gives the best chance of
keeping all the planets on screen so you can see the patterns.

As usual, there's a link in the video description, or you can just visit MinuteLabs.io
and look for the Chaotic Planets Lab.

Special thanks goes to Nick Bartzokas for helping out with the coding.

Also, in case you missed it, be sure to also check out our Fusion Lab
done in collaboration with PHD Comics. We didn't make a teaser video for it like
our other labs,
That's why following MinuteLabs on Subbable is the best way to make sure you
don't miss any of our creations.
